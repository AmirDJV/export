Description: Package to export R graphs and R stats objects to Microsoft Word, 
    Microsoft Powerpoint and HTML Documents. Export uses packages ReporteRs, 
    xtable and rtable as a backbone. All export is in native Microsoft Office format 
    -- editable DrawingML vector format for graphs and tables for R stats objects (e.g.
    anova, linear regression, GLM or lme4 mixed model output tables), and can use corporate
    template documents for styling. The two main functions enable the currently
    showing R graph or the currently showing R stats object to be exported in MS Office
    format using a single command. The package does not require any installation of Microsoft 
    product to be able to write Microsoft files (docx and pptx) and output files are also 
    fully compatible with LibreOffice. The two main application areas of this package
    are producing standardized reports and being able to manually edit the layout of
    R graphs in vector format using Powerpoint. Base R, ggplot2, lattice and grid plots
    are supported, as well as all the most common R stats objects, including aov, lm,
    glm, lme, lmer, glmer, coxph, ftable, xtabs, ts, zoo and prcomp output as well
    as tables, matrices and data frames.
