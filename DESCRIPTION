Description: Easily export 'R' graphs and statistical output to 'Microsoft Office' 
    / 'LibreOffice', 'Latex' and 'HTML' Documents. Export uses packages 'ReporteRs',
    'grDevices', 'stargazer', 'xtable' and 'rtable' as a backbone and uses defaults that
    result in publication-quality output using simple, straightforward commands. 
    Output to 'Microsoft Office' is in editable 'DrawingML' vector format for graphs,
    and can use corporate template documents for styling. This enables the production
    of standardized reports and also allows for manual tidy-up of the layout of 'R' graphs 
    in 'Powerpoint' before final publication. Export of graphs is flexible, and 
    functions enable the currently showing R graph or the currently showing 'R' stats 
    object to be exported, but also allow the graphs or stats output to be passed as 
    objects. The package does not require any installation of 'Microsoft' 
    product to be able to write 'Microsoft' files ('docx' and 'pptx') and output files are 
    also fully compatible with 'LibreOffice'. Base 'R', 'ggplot2' and 'lattice' plots
    are supported, as well as all the most common 'R' stats objects, including 'aov', 'lm',
    'glm', 'lme', 'lmer', 'glmer', 'coxph', 'ftable', 'xtabs', 'ts', 'zoo' and 'prcomp' 
    output as well as tables, matrices and data frames.
