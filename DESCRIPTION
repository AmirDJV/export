Description: Easily export 'R' graphs and statistical output to 'Microsoft Office' 
    / 'LibreOffice', 'Latex' and 'HTML' Documents, using sensible defaults that 
    result in publication-quality output with simple, straightforward commands. 
    Output to 'Microsoft Office' is in editable 'DrawingML' vector format for graphs,
    and can use corporate template documents for styling. This enables the production
    of standardized reports and also allows for manual tidy-up of the layout of 'R' graphs 
    in 'Powerpoint' before final publication. Export of graphs is flexible, and 
    functions enable the currently showing R graph or the currently showing 'R' stats 
    object to be exported, but also allow the graphs or stats output to be passed as 
    objects. The package relies on package 'ReporteRs' for export to 'Office',and output 
    files are also fully compatible with 'LibreOffice'. Base 'R', 'ggplot2' and 'lattice' plots
    are supported, as well as all as a wide variety of 'R' stats objects, via wrappers
    to 'xtable' and 'stargazer', including 'aov', 'lm', 'glm', 'lme', 'lmer', 'glmer' and 
    'coxph' as well as 'ftable' and 'xtabs' cross-tabulations, matrices and data frames.
